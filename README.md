# Urban Naari Order Tracker

Internal dashboard for tracking Urban Naari Shopify orders via DTDC courier. Pulls fulfilled orders from Shopify, fetches live tracking from DTDC, stores everything in Notion, and displays it in a dark-themed Command Center dashboard.

## Features

- **Shopify sync** — pulls all fulfilled orders with tracking numbers
- **DTDC tracking** — fetches live status, milestones, and delivery timeline
- **Notion storage** — all data stored in the cloud, accessible from any device
- **Command Center dashboard** — dark theme with Orders, Influencer, Abandoned Checkouts, and Analytics tabs
- **Auto-refresh** — polls DTDC every 30 minutes for non-delivered orders
- **COD tracking** — pending amount display, collection toggle, and Shopify mark-as-paid sync
- **Shipping charge tracking** — per-order "Shipping Paid" toggle (orders + influencer) with a dashboard "Shipping Pending" widget summing unpaid courier charges
- **WhatsApp automation** — auto-send messages for COD confirmation, fulfilment + tracking, RTO follow-ups, and abandoned-checkout recovery (paired with a Chrome extension that auto-clicks Send)
- **Abandoned checkouts** — list, message, and track recovery attempts; supports image-grid clipboard for product photos
- **Delivery emails** — manually triggered delivery confirmation emails via SMTP
- **Influencer shipments** — separate tracking, product checklist, video-received workflow, Jaipur in-person flow
- **Analytics** — delivery rate, RTO rate, stuck orders, COD collection %, top destinations

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- A Shopify store with a custom app (Client ID + Secret)
- A [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) with a shared page

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```
# Shopify
SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_URL=your-store.myshopify.com

# Notion
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key
NOTION_PAGE_ID=your_notion_page_id

# SMTP (for delivery emails)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email
SMTP_PASS=your_password
SMTP_FROM=your_from_address

# Email Test Mode (redirects all emails to your inbox instead of customers)
EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true
EMAIL_TEST_RECIPIENT=your_test_email@example.com
```

### 3. Set up Notion database

Run once to create the database in your Notion page:

```bash
npx tsx src/lib/notion-setup.ts
```

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Key Behaviors

- **Order sorting**: Orders are sorted by Shopify Order ID in descending order to display them in proper sequential order
- **Order filter**: Orders #1025 and below are hidden (initial test orders)
- **Auto-refresh**: Tracking refreshes every 30 minutes
- **Delayed flag**: Orders in transit for 7+ days are highlighted in red
- **Return window**: 48-hour return window tracked after delivery
- **Delivery emails**: Branded template (coral palette matching website), manually triggered, with browser preview at `/api/email/preview?orderId=`
- **Email test mode**: Set `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` to redirect all emails to `EMAIL_TEST_RECIPIENT` instead of customers
- **Status mapping**: DTDC statuses map to 17 internal states (`src/lib/data/types.ts`): Unfulfilled, Booked, Picked Up, In Transit, At Destination, Out for Delivery, Delivered, Undelivered, RTO, RTO Confirmed, RTO Received, Return Initiated, Return Complete, Video Received, Product Received Back, Completed, Cancelled
- **RTO flow** (3-stage, all manual transitions): RTO → RTO Confirmed (after operator reaches customer) → RTO Received (when product arrives back at warehouse). DTDC RTO-prefix events do not auto-advance status.
- **Return flow**: Delivered → Initiate Return → Mark Return Complete (when product arrives back)
- **Cancelled orders**: hidden everywhere in the dashboard (cancel still writes to Notion + Shopify, just no row is rendered). Verify in Shopify admin.
- **Return Complete**: hidden from main list; appears only when "Show Delivered" is toggled on.
- **Status guard**: `src/lib/status-machine.ts` blocks invalid auto-transitions (e.g. RTO→Delivered) during DTDC refresh; manual transitions always allowed.
- **Influencer terminal statuses**: `Video Received` and `Completed` are set manually after delivery and represent post-DTDC workflow state. `/api/influencer/refresh` skips shipments in these statuses entirely (no DTDC call, no Notion write), so refresh-tracking can never roll them back to `Delivered`.
